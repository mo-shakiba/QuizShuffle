Have you ever had a file containing several questions?
Whether you are a teacher or a student, this program lets you enter the name of a text file, and a number(n), and will create a .txt file containing n questions randomly picked for you.
## How to run

To run the program:
```bash
  python main.py -n "filename.txt"
```

Enter the number of questions you want: (e.g. 12)
```bash
  Number of Questions: 12
```

Enter a name to save your file: (e.g. Output.txt)
```bash
  File Name: Output.txt
```

You should see the following output:
```bash
  'Done! Output.txt is created.'
```
